# gifTastic

Using the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice of animals.

Instructions
1.) When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page. Under every gif, display its rating (PG, G, so on).
2.) When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.
3.) You can also search for your own gifs. Just type into the search bar. A button will be placed at the bottom. Hit the button at the buttom and your new button should populate the gifs on the screen.
